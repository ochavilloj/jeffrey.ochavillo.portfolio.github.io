[Predicting Wine Analysis](/pdf/Nordstrom_Product_Data_Analysis.html)
<br>
This project explores the factors influencing the quality of red wine using machine learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The focus is on a dataset from the Portuguese 'Vinho Verde' variant, analyzing physicochemical properties such as volatile acidity, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, sulfates, and alcohol. The goal is to identify key variables that impact wine quality, offering insights into the structure of the data and predicting wine ratings. With a CNN model tuned for optimal performance, this project achieves a test accuracy of 53.6%, providing a foundation for understanding the nuances of red wine quality through data science.

[Retail Crime Analysis in Seattle during Holiday Season](/pdf/Nordstrom_Product_Data_Analysis.html)
<br>
This project explores retail crime patterns in Downtown Seattle using ArcGIS, focusing on the heightened activity during the holiday season. Using spatial analysis techniques, I identified hot spots and cold spots for retail-related crimes such as robberies, theft, and burglaries. Key findings include high-density crime areas around shopping centers like West Lake Park, Marion Street, and East Pike Street. This analysis aims to assist local businesses, law enforcement, and city planners in understanding crime trends and implementing effective safety measures during critical shopping periods.

[Solving Linear Regression Using Numerical Methods](/pdf/Nordstrom_Product_Data_Analysis.html)
<br>
This project explores different numerical methods for solving linear regression using the EdGap dataset, which includes various socioeconomic indicators and average ACT scores of schools. The project starts by cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling missing values, and normalizing predictors. It then fits a linear regression model using scikit-learn and compares the results with custom implementations using various numerical methods: solving the normal equations directly, using Cholesky decomposition, QR factorization, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Each method's results, including model coefficients, are compared for accuracy and consistency with the scikit-learn model. Additionally, the project assesses the computational efficiency of each method using timing functions. This comprehensive approach highlights the strengths and trade-offs of different numerical methods in solving regression problems, providing valuable insights into linear algebra techniques and their application in data analysis.

[Logistic Regression and Optimization: A Comparative Analysis on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](/pdf/Nordstrom_Product_Data_Analysis.html)
<br>
This project involves implementing logistic regression to classify tumor types using the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. It explores both scikit-learn's built-in logistic regression and a custom implementation using Newton's method for optimization. After loading and examining the dataset, the project visualizes the relationship between tumor characteristics and classes, then trains a logistic regression model using scikit-learn. Additionally, the project implements Newton's method to fit a logistic regression model, using functions to calculate the cross-entropy cost, gradient, and Hessian matrix. The results from both approaches are compared, highlighting differences in coefficients and model performance. Finally, the logistic functions from both models are plotted against the data, providing a visual comparison of their predictions. This project deepens the understanding of logistic regression and optimization techniques, offering insights into iterative methods like Newton's method.

[NBA Players Salaries Analysis](/pdf/Nordstrom_Product_Data_Analysis.html)
<br>
Using RStudio, I applied Multiple Linear Regression and Linear Regression to find correlations between skills within the sport of basketball to the salaries of the players. Used the 2017-2018 NBA seasons. In addition I used Liner Regressions to make predictions of future salaries for players. In my presentation I used this method with Giannis Antetokounmpo
